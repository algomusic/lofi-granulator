The LoFi Granulator is a DIY handheld musical instrument designed to enable live control over the granulation of short audio recordings stored on SD card. 
The instrument runs on an ESP32 microcontroller using the [M16 audio library](https://github.com/algomusic/M16). It features a laser cut wooden enclosure with built-in stereo speakers and battery power.

The instrument is designed by Andrew R. Brown and John Ferguson in 2025 for the [ARC Regional Electronic Music Project](https://www.regionalelectronicmusicaustralia.com/).
